# PlayNow

As part of a school project, I built this GUI to solve an everyday problem: occupied sports facilties in my appartment complex. It lets residents register themselves over WLAN and then prebook sporting facities, find sports buddies, lend/borrow equipment and even find coaches. Unfortunately I lost the code for the registration functionality when my laptop crashed, but you can checkout the video below to see how it worked.
